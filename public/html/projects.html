    <h3> Aahhh, siteception! </h3>
    <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: Sept 2018 </p>
    <p> Recently I created my own portfolio site, which you are browsing right now. I really wanted improve my web development skills and this project was great for that. My aim for this site was to have an overview of the stuff I've done and to give some insights into who I am and the things I like doing. The frontend is written in Javascript, HTML and CSS and I use nodejs on the server side. I deployed the project on an AWS' EC2 instance, using Docker to create separate containers (I'm hosting muliple sites on this server). I also set up a reverse proxy by creating and configuring an Nginx container. The project so far is still a WIP, in my next iteration I will be adding a backend, so I can add content that will be served by the frontend (currectly I'm using nodejs to serve static pages). So, in short, still lots to do, but I'm happy with this first version and already learned a lot so far!</p>

        <h3> Cyber Attack: Unity game development</h3>
        <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: May 2018 </p>
        <p> Applying the Agile approach, this project was a collaboration with five other developers. We created Cyber Attack, an educational game aimed to teach school children about cyber security. This project was our first experience of developing a 3D game in Unity. My personal contribution to this project was mainly creative design (using tools such as Inkscape and Blender) - from background designs to 3D enemy objects. I also integrated all custom 3D objects into the game, ensuring their supposed look and behaviour. Other ways of contributing to the codebase were by developing the concept of health and certain virus behaviour. From a conceptual perspective, I also helped researching and defining the educational aspect of the game prior and throughout development. </p>

    <h3> Aptus Admin: a site management tool</h3>
    <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: May 2018 </p>
    <p> Aptus Admin is a tool for people managing sites for multiple clients. This being a collaborative project, I designed and developed the server side of it, focussing on scalability and security. Using Express and nodejs, I created all routes to and from the server. Since access to the site had to be restricted, I developed an authentication module from the ground up. The module includes JWT generation and validation and deals with cookie handling (sending and parsing) to store tokens. I also created a separate database module that deals with all the SQLite queries, making it easy for other developers to communicate to the database using set functions. </p>

    <h3> Tic Tac Toe</h3>
    <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: February 2018 </p>
    <p> This is a simple Noughts and Crosses game playable from the terminal, written in Java. I used this game to delve more into OOP after previously having written all my projects in C. The game lets two people play against each other over a local network. I also wanted to design the game in such a way, that it would be easily scalable, for example by exploring the idea of setting your own board dimensions. The game underwent thorough unit testing during development, which I also put on GitHub. </p>

        <h3> Spelling checker</h3>
        <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: Dec 2017 <br> </p>
        <p> Using the same BST ADT that I creating for an earlier project, I wrote a spelling checker using binary search trees. This short program reads in a dictionary file and stores each word in a dictionary BST. It then reads in a second text file and checks each word of this file with the words stored in the dictionary BST. Each misspelt word is printed out and also added to a second (misspelt) BST so that no misspelled word is printed twice.</p>

        <h3> 34C3 Conference </h3>
        <p> Category: Tech, Travel <br> Date: Dec 2017 </p>
        <p> As usual, I traveled to Germany this december for the Chaos Computer Conference, the biggest hackers conference in the EU. I had a great time and thought I'd share a few of my highlights of the trip. Firstly, my favorite talk this year was the <a target="_blank" href="https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9064-the_ultimate_apollo_guidance_computer_talk">The Ultimate Apollo Guidance Computer Talk </a>, by Michael Steil and Christian Hessmann. Another talk, less technical but just as interesting, was Katika KÃ¼hnreich's talk <a target="_blank" href="https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-8874-gamified_control"> Gamified Control? </a>, about China's Social Credit System. On top of that, Dennis Giese and DanielAW's talk <a target="_blank" href="https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9147-unleash_your_smart-home_devices_vacuum_cleaning_robot_hacking">Unleash your smart-home devices: Vacuum Cleaning Robot Hacking</a> was hilarious as well as really informative.<br><br>This year I also finally managed to grab a spot for the lock picking workshop, which was super fun (I think I'm gonna buy a set so I can start practising at home). I also messed around with wooden clothespins, a soldering kit and some LEDS's resulting in funky blinking LEDs that I could attach to anyhting (and anybody). A cool robot made me some yummy waffles, which I ate while gawking at all the expositions and installations being build in the Assembly hall. Also met up with other conference goers and traditionally drank lots of Club Mate and Tschunk! <br><br>After the conference (which was in Leipzig) I traveled to Berlin. Only having one day in Berlin (and having been in Berlin twice beforehand), I went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.story-of-berlin.de/eng/about_us"> The Story Of Berlin</a>, a really interesting and interactive museum about the city's history. This included a tour through an old bunker, which was built as a shelter in case of a nuclear disaster during the Cold War. Hightly recommend a visit! </p>

    <h3> Visualising binary search trees</h3>
    <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: Dec 2017 </p>
    <p> I used this project to learn more about binary search trees. To start with, I implemented an Abstract Data Type (ADT) for binary search trees (BST). Using C as the language for this project, the ADT allows you store keys in an ordered manner and allows you to perform tasks such as finding the size of the tree, add entries to the tree and find a particular entry in the tree. For the visualisation part of the project I used Graphviz and the dot language. I implemented a dot ADT and a user file, that together create a dotfile of a string provided by the user. The generated dotfile is then rendered into a png, which visualises the tree. To play around with the functionalities of Graphviz a bit, I made each node blue when it contains the letter 'u'.</p>

    <h3> 8-bit processor simulation </h3>
    <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: Dec 2017 </p>
    <p> Using computer architector simulator <a href=""> ModuleSim </a>, I built a 8-bit processor. This project was really fun to do and, thanks to the simulation software, felt really 'hands on' despite not actually working with the real hardware. It helped increase my understanding of electrical components such as logic gates, registers, multiplexors and arithmetic units and was a good addition </p>

    <h3> NAND-gates: JK and D-latch MS flip flops </h3>
    <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: Nov 2017 </p>
    <p> The aim of this project was to learn more about flip flop circuits. I build a positive triggered JK Master Slave Flip Flop and a D-type Master Slave flip flop. Just as with the full adder project, I used Logisim to design a simulation of the circuit and - once I knew it was working - built both the flip flops using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danpage/nandboard">these NAND boards</a>. However, figuring out how to built these flip flops was a bit harder, as I couldn't proof these circuits with boolean logic (it's sequential logic instead). However, by starting small with first buildig a SR latch, then moving on towards SR FF, then the D-latch FF, the JK FF and only THEN adding the master slave components to it, definitely made it doable (also, truth tables are your best friend here). </p>

        <h3> Text comparison </h3>
        <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: Nov 2017 </p>
        <p> This program - written in C - compares two text documents with each other and tells you how many unique words are contained in each file as well as giving you the amount of words both files have in common. To make this work, I wrote an ADT for sets that contains operations such as creating sets, add elements to them, return the size, check a set for a certain value etc. I also used Valgrind to check the program for memory loss, to ensure there were no leaks in my program. A makefile is provided to simply start the program (the files that need to be compared with each other need to be provided by the user of the program). </p>

    <h3> NAND-boards: Full and Half Adder </h3>
    <p> Category: Tech <br> Date: Oct 2017 </p>
    <p> This project was my first experience with eletronics and circuit boards. The idea was to build a chained full adder that could perform additions up to a sum of N-bits (depending on the amount of adders in the chain). The way I approached designing this circuit, was by writing down its truth table first. With the help of the truth table, I could then point out the logical relationship in the form of formulas S (the Sum) and C (the carry). By simplifying the formulas, it shows you exactly how the logic gates in the circuit are connected with each other. I then created the circuits as simulations in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html">Logisim</a> to see if my design was correct. Once that was finished, I used <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danpage/nandboard">these NAND boards</a> to build the circuits 'for real'. </p>
