<h3> Data Analyst and Strategy Consultant</h3>
<p> Medical After Care Research, Nov 2014 <br>London, United Kingdom </p>
<p> As a bilingual freelancer focussing on strategy research and data analysis,
I worked on a short term project at Bain and Company. During this project, my
research focussed on medical after care.
<br><br>
By gathering and analysing qualative and quantative data I detected
and mapped trends in the market of certain medical after care. The key findings
of my analysis presented potential market risks and opportunities, which helped
to shape the market strategy presented to the client.
