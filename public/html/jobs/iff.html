<h3> Data Collector and Translator</h3>
<p> Automotive Research, Nov 2014 <br>London, United Kingdom </p>
<p> As a bilingual freelancer focussing on strategy research and data analysis,
I worked on a short term project at the International Institute for Field Research.
During this project, I gathered data about the Dutch automotive market and
provided English to Dutch translations.
