<h3> Data Analyst and Strategy Consultant</h3>
<p> Medical Technology Research, Jan 2015 - Feb 2015 <br>London, United Kingdom </p>
<p> As a bilingual freelancer focussing on strategy research and data analysis,
I was hired by L.E.K. Consulting to assist them with a short term project.
My research focussed on the use of technology during vitreoretinal surgery
in the Netherlands.
<br><br>
My work entailed being the key contact person for the Dutch market. I provided
translations, conducted interviews with Dutch surgeons and gathered and analysed
market data. Through this, I was able to detect market trends and patterns,
which I would then present to senior consultants.
