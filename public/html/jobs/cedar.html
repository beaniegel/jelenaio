<h3> Student Enterprise Ambassador </h3>
<p> Enterprise and Entrepreneurship, Jan 2014 - Jun 2014 <br> Cambridge, United Kingdom </p>
<p> As Anglia Ruskin University's student enterprise ambassador, my goal was to promote enterprise and entrepreneurship to ARU students. To
   achieve this, I helped organise events and guest lectures and provided feedback to CEDAR related to these events and the student attitude towards them.
   I was also the organisation's representative for the faculty of Arts, Law and Social Sciences, which meant I promoted various events, such as workshops and business competitions, to
   the students of this faculty. <p>
