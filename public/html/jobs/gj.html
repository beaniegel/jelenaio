<h3> Creative Editor (Content & Design) </h3>
<p> Publishing Internship, Sept 2013 - Sept 2013 <br>New Delhi, India </p>
<p> During my internship at Maxposure Media Group India (part of Gruner + Jahr International),
  I worked on the autumn issue of fashion and lifestyle magazine L'Officiel. I wrote features, designed
  page lay-outs and performed basic admin work. Together with two other interns, I also
  constructed and conducted an Audience Research Survey for Lâ€™Officiel.	After subsequently analysing the
  survey data, we constructed a plan to increase audience numbers and presented this to the company board.<p>
