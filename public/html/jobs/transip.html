<h3> Project Manager and Marketing Expert </h3>
<p> Web and Cloud Hosting, March 2015 - Sept 2016<br>Leiden, The Netherlands</p>
<p> During my time at TransIP, I researched, planned and managed projects of teams
  ranging from 5-10 people. Working together with developers, design and customer
  care specialists, I had a diverse project portfolio: from improving the company's
  billing process, to enhancing faker detection, to ensuring smooth product handovers.
  <br><br>
  Also being the marketing specialist of my team, I created, executed and
  managed branding related projects. I made sure the tone of voice on the website
  and in ads expressed TransIP's values and identity, using A/B testing to contineously
  monitor and improve our communication. I also ran social media and Google
  advertising campaigns to increase our brand awareness. These projects triggered
  more traffic to our website, resulting in more site transactions and job applications.
